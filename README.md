AdMobWrapper
============

Demo application for LayerCake (wraps AdMob library for embedding).

This application acts as a wrapper around the AdMob advertising library, allowing other applications to embed ads without needing to include AdMob's library code themselves.

You will need to download and reference the AdMob library: https://developers.google.com/mobile-ads-sdk/
